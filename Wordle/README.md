# Wordle

This is a Python script that helps you play [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

There are 3 modes:

- Help mode (h): Got stuck? Use this mode to input all your tries (and the colors) so far, and I will suggest a word for you.
- Computer mode (c): The computer will try to guess the word. All you need to input is the color of the computer\'s try.
- Play (p): You can play a Wordle game here.
